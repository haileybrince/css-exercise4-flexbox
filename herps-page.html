About Herps
This page is about herps.

This page is using display: flex to create the two-column sidebar in a fixed-width layout. To create this layout you need to add:

All the proper layout ids (banner, menu, sidebar, colophon) added to their proper tags
A div to create the livespace with the id of wrapper
A div to create the "flex container" which encompasses the aside and the main as the two columns
Use the flex property to divide up the space instead of percentages, then us gap property in the flex container to create a space between them.
Important! To put the sidebar on the right, you can just change the flex-direction in your flexbox to reverse the order in CSS. No need to change the order in your markup.

Herps, or reptiles and amphibians, can make fun and engaging pets. Learn more about them here!
